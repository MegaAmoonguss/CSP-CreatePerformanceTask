# GMath-py
The old GMath Java library reworked and greatly improved. Some important functions still have to be added.

## Install
To install, download the source and run:
```
$ pip install .
```
Pass `--upgrade` to upgrade.

## To do
* Add ability to recognize and calculate equations of arithmetic, geometric, and quadratic sequences
* Change functions to straight arguments instead of operations, leave operations for other features like possibly file output, logging, etc
